# Literature Review


**Summary of Each Work**:

- **Deep learning models for tuberculosis detection and infected region visualization in chest X-ray images** [[Link]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2667102623000438)
  
  - Sharma V. et al. reported excellent results using two deep learning models for analyzing lung images with tuberculosis lesions. The UNet model delivered high performance in segmenting these lesions, achieving 96.35% accuracy, 90.38% Jaccard index, 94.88% Dice coefficient, and 99.00% AUC. Meanwhile, the Xception model demonstrated strong classification capabilities, with high scores in accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC for detecting tuberculosis-related lesions.

  - Hansun S. et al. [2] conducted a comprehensive review of 47 studies, highlighting the effectiveness of machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) for tuberculosis detection using chest X-rays. Their analysis showed that ML achieved higher accuracy and sensitivity (93.71% and 92.55%), while DL performed better in terms of AUC and specificity (92.12% and 91.54%). However, the presence of biases in reference standards and timing indicates a need for more rigorous study designs
