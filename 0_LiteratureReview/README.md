- **Source 1**: Deep learning models for tuberculosis detection and infected region visualization in chest X-ray images [[Link]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2667102623000438)
  Sharma V. et al. reported excellent results using two deep learning models for analyzing lung images with tuberculosis lesions. The UNet model delivered high performance in segmenting these lesions, achieving 96.35% accuracy, 90.38% Jaccard index, 94.88% Dice coefficient, and 99.00% AUC. Meanwhile, the Xception model demonstrated strong classification capabilities, with high scores in accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC for detecting tuberculosis-related lesions.
