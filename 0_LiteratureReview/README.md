# Literature Review : Tuberculosis Detection

Tuberculosis (TB) continues to be a major public health concern worldwide, necessitating rapid and reliable diagnostic approaches. In recent years, the application of machine learning and deep learning methods to chest X-ray images has attracted considerable research attention for automated TB detection. Several studies have investigated the effectiveness of different AI models, comparing their segmentation, classification, and overall diagnostic performance. The following literature review summarizes key findings from recent research in this domain.

  - Sharma V. et al. reported excellent results using two deep learning models for analyzing lung images with tuberculosis lesions. The UNet model delivered high performance in segmenting these lesions, achieving 96.35% accuracy, 90.38% Jaccard index, 94.88% Dice coefficient, and 99.00% AUC. Meanwhile, the Xception model demonstrated strong classification capabilities, with high scores in accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC for detecting tuberculosis-related lesions.

  - Hansun S. et al. conducted a comprehensive review of 47 studies, highlighting the effectiveness of machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) for tuberculosis detection using chest X-rays. Their analysis showed that ML achieved higher accuracy and sensitivity (93.71% and 92.55%), while DL performed better in terms of AUC and specificity (92.12% and 91.54%). However, the presence of biases in reference standards and timing indicates a need for more rigorous study designs

  - Sana Sahar Guia et al. developed a deep learning model for tuberculosis detection in chest X-rays by integrating VGG16 and VGG19 architectures with an attention mechanism. This model achieved very high classification accuracies—0.9966 on the training set and 0.9978 on the validation set. The authors suggest that future improvements could involve using reinforcement learning algorithms to enhance the model’s consistency in classifying difficult images.
